//
// Stryker mutation testing config — P2-1 baseline.
//
// Uses the command test runner with coverage analysis OFF because the bun
// test runner doesn't emit a coverage report Stryker can parse natively.
// Without coverage analysis, every mutant triggers a full `bun run test`
// run, so the per-test-suite runtime dominates.
//
// SCOPE NOTE (2026-07-06): the initial P2-1 run is scoped to ONE file —
// `src/security/compare.ts` — for the first smoke. The original scope
// was wider (security + proxy + registry) but turned out to be 5548
// mutants × ~30s each at concurrency=1 = ~46h, far too slow for an
// actionable baseline. Smoke-then-expand:
//
//   smoke  — compare.ts (single security primitive, the constant-time
//            string compare that protects API-key/session/CSRF checks).
//            ~30 mutants × 30s ≈ 15 min. Goal: validate the pipeline
//            end-to-end and get a real score for the most
//            security-critical primitive.
//   expand — after smoke succeeds, re-run with `src/security/**/*.ts`
//            (~500-800 mutants, ~5-8h).
//   expand — re-run with `src/proxy/**/*.ts` too if budget allows.
//
// (Note: glob patterns intentionally NOT shown inline — a `**` followed by
// `/` inside a `/* */` block comment would close the comment early, which
// is why we use plain `compare.ts` paths.)
//
// CONCURRENCY (2026-07-06): MUST be 1. Reproduced failure: with
// `concurrency: 8`, Stryker's command-test-runner spawns 8 parallel
// `bun run test` processes from the SAME sandbox CWD. Confirmed locally:
// 8 parallel bun:test runs from the sandbox produced 1223 pass / 4 fail
// (vs the serial baseline 1227/0). The 4 failures are resource
// contention — SQLite lock + Express port-bind + bun:test snapshot file
// collisions between workers. Stryker's command-test-runner maps
// `exitCode !== 0` to a single "All tests" Failed result, which the
// dry-run executor then turns into `ConfigError: There were failed
// tests in the initial test run`. To use concurrency>1 here we'd need
// perTest coverage analysis + sandbox isolation per worker — out of
// scope for P2-1.
//
// To run:                 bun run test:mutate
// To run a single mutant: bunx stryker run --mutate src/security/compare.ts
//

  commandRunner: {
    // Use the wrapper at `scripts/stryker-test-runner.ts` instead of
    // `bun run test` directly. The wrapper exists for one reason:
    // Stryker's `command` test runner uses Node's `child_process.exec`,
    // which buffers child stdout/stderr up to `maxBuffer` (1 MB default).
    // Our `bun run test` produces ~7 MB of output per run, so the buffer
    // overflows, Node kills the child with SIGTERM, and Stryker sees a
    // non-zero exit → `All tests` Failed → the dry run rejects the run
    // even though the suite is 1227 pass / 0 fail. The wrapper spawns the
    // test command via `Bun.spawn` (no buffer cap, output streams to a
    // file) and propagates the exit code. It also pins
    // `NODE_ENV=test` + `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` so `.env.test`'s
    // hermetic overrides win over the sandbox's `.env`. See
    // `scripts/stryker-test-runner.ts` for the full rationale.
    //
    // Note on the `--path-ignore-patterns={admin-ui,e2e}/**` filter: it
    // is required because bare `bun test` (no args) sweeps up
    // `admin-ui/src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` (Vitest specs needing jsdom
    // — fail with "document is not defined") and `e2e/*.spec.ts`
    // (Playwright specs — fail with "Playwright Test did not expect
    // test() to be called here"). The wrapper invokes `bun test` with
    // that filter applied directly. See CLAUDE.md §Commands.
