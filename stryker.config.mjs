//
// Stryker mutation testing config — P2-3 expanded security scope.
//
// Uses the command test runner with coverage analysis OFF because the bun
// test runner doesn't emit a coverage report Stryker can parse natively.
// Without coverage analysis, every mutant triggers a full `bun run test`
// run, so the per-test-suite runtime dominates.
//
// SCOPE HISTORY:
//
//   P2-1  compare.ts only                 6 mutants   3m26s   66.67% (baseline)
//   P2-2  compare.ts only (with new tests) 6 mutants   3m29s  100.00% (closed)
//   P2-3a src/security/*.ts (12 files)   946 mutants  ABORTED @ 48.7%
//         461/946 tested, 140 survived -> ~284 projected. Too many to
//         kill in one commit; and with no incremental JSON a mid-run
//         abort yields ZERO data (the json/html reports only flush on
//         completion), so the 12-file / ~8h scope was over-sized.
//         Reverted to the P2-1/P2-2 incremental pattern below.
//   P2-3  4 small critical files          112 mutants  98.21% (110/112)
//         The 2 survivors are proven-equivalent mutants (unkillable), so the
//         effective score is 100% (110/110 non-equivalent killed): key-hash
//         L20 `length === 0` (redundant with `[].some() === false`) and
//         secret-box L35 `"utf8"` (Bun treats `""` as the utf8 default).
//         cookies.ts and system-role.ts both reached a clean 100%.
//   P2-4  bootstrap-admin + startup-guards  101 mutants  100.00% (101/101)
//         bootstrap-admin needed a logger SPY (spyOn) — 15 of its 16 survivors
//         were log() level/message/meta literals, killable only by asserting
//         the log call. startup-guards needed each reason chunk asserted + a
//         bare-string corsOrigins to hit the `[env.corsOrigins]` wrap.
//   P2-5  session-store + user-store        99 mutants  95.96% (95/99; 4 equiv)
//         Effective 100% — 4 proven-equivalent survivors: session-store L77
//         (safeCompare on a row fetched by that same hash is unreachable),
//         user-store L8 (typeof guard redundant with ADMIN_ROLES.includes), and
//         updateUser L111 `>=0`/`→true` (guarded by if(!existing), changes
//         always 1). First run scoped via STRYKER_TEST_SCOPE=src/security/
//         __tests__ (~24x faster: 3m28s vs ~84m; scoped-run commit 18052c4).
//
// P2-1/P2-2 used a single file (compare.ts) to validate the pipeline
// end-to-end. P2-3 keeps that incremental pattern rather than mutating
// all of `src/security/*.ts` at once (12 files / 946 mutants / ~8h /
// ~284 survivors — too coarse for a single commit): we scope to the 4
// smallest security-critical files and drive each to 100%. Stryker's
// default `mutate` excludes `__tests__/`, `__snapshots__/`, and
// `*.test.*` from the mutant set, so test files are never mutated
// regardless of what we list here.
//
// Remaining src/security/ files → dedicated follow-up tickets, largest
// last: oidc.ts (429 LOC), mcp-key-store.ts (242), jwt.ts (229),
// session-store.ts (140), user-store.ts (124), startup-guards.ts (79),
// bootstrap-admin.ts (53). Then src/proxy (pipeline), src/mcp/registry.
//
// (Note: glob patterns intentionally NOT shown inline — a `**` followed by
// `/` inside a `/* */` block comment would close the comment early, which
// is why we use `src/security/*.ts` and refer to `src/proxy/...` as plain
// paths in the comments above.)
//
// CONCURRENCY (2026-07-06): MUST be 1. Reproduced failure: with
// `concurrency: 8`, Stryker's command-test-runner spawns 8 parallel
// `bun run test` processes from the SAME sandbox CWD. Confirmed locally:
// 8 parallel bun:test runs from the sandbox produced 1223 pass / 4 fail
// (vs the serial baseline 1227/0). The 4 failures are resource
// contention — SQLite lock + Express port-bind + bun:test snapshot file
// collisions between workers. Stryker's command-test-runner maps
// `exitCode !== 0` to a single "All tests" Failed result, which the
// dry-run executor then turns into `ConfigError: There were failed
// tests in the initial test run`. To use concurrency>1 here we'd need
// perTest coverage analysis + sandbox isolation per worker — out of
// scope for P2-3.
//
// To run:                 bun run test:mutate
// To run a single file:   bunx stryker run --mutate src/security/compare.ts

  commandRunner: {
    // Use the wrapper at `scripts/stryker-test-runner.ts` instead of
    // `bun run test` directly. The wrapper exists for one reason:
    // Stryker's `command` test runner uses Node's `child_process.exec`,
    // which buffers child stdout/stderr up to `maxBuffer` (1 MB default).
    // Our `bun run test` produces ~7 MB of output per run, so the buffer
    // overflows, Node kills the child with SIGTERM, and Stryker sees a
    // non-zero exit → `All tests` Failed → the dry run rejects the run
    // even though the suite is 1227 pass / 0 fail. The wrapper spawns the
    // test command via `Bun.spawn` (no buffer cap, output streams to a
    // file) and propagates the exit code. It also pins
    // `NODE_ENV=test` + `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` so `.env.test`'s
    // hermetic overrides win over the sandbox's `.env`. See
    // `scripts/stryker-test-runner.ts` for the full rationale.
    //
    // Note on the `--path-ignore-patterns={admin-ui,e2e}/**` filter: it
    // is required because bare `bun test` (no args) sweeps up
    // `admin-ui/src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` (Vitest specs needing jsdom
    // — fail with "document is not defined") and `e2e/*.spec.ts`
    // (Playwright specs — fail with "Playwright Test did not expect
    // test() to be called here"). The wrapper invokes `bun test` with
    // that filter applied directly. See CLAUDE.md §Commands.
